ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://data-dashboard-levanib.vercel.app/)

A comprehensive book collection dashboard that visualizes library data through interactive charts, statistics, and filtering capabilities. Built with vanilla JavaScript showcasing advanced array methods and modern web development techniques.

## What I Learned & Implemented

- **Advanced Array Methods**: Extensively used `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `every()`, and `some()` for data processing and transformation
- **Object Manipulation**: Leveraged `Object.entries()`, `Object.keys()`, and `Object.values()` for data analysis and chart generation
- **Destructuring Patterns**: Implemented throughout codebase for cleaner parameter handling and object property access
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive charts using DOM manipulation and CSS styling
- **DOM Manipulation**: Built dynamic UI components and real-time data updates
- **Event Handling**: Managed search, filtering, and sorting interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Developed mobile-friendly layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Data Transformation**: Used `map()` to create multiple data views and summary cards
